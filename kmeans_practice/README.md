# K means algorithm practice
I performed Kmeans algorithm on MNIST dataset which can be found [here](datasethttps://www.python-course.eu/data/mnist/mnist_test.csv) .

What I did:
* Run k-means 10 times. Report the best result in terms of k-means cost value and present the corresponding centroids and images.
* Create the confusion matrix C.
* Match the numbers and ground true labels by solving a linear assignment problem for C. 
* Report the accuracy.
