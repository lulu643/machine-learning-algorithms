# Spectural Clustering Practice
I performed spectural clustering on the MNIST dataset  I love this method!

What I did:
* I tried 3 choices σ2 gamma value for Gaussian kernel and compare the result .
* Report my result by computing the error rate. Plot the Fiedler eigenvector for each of my choice of σ2 gamma value .
