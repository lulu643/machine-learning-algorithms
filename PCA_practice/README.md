# PCA practice
I performed principal component analysis algorithm on YaleFace dataset which consists of 2414 images of size 32 Ã— 32 (each column is a vectorized image). 

What I did:
* Compute the mean image, as well as the first 16 principal components. Present the components as images. 
* Use the first 10 principal components plus the mean to approximate the first face image.
