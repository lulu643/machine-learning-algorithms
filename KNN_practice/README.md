# KNN
I used K nearest neighbor algorithm to classify Iris flowers. 

What I did:
* Build a KNeighborsClassifier with k = 1 to predict the class. 
* Calculate the accuracy of the KNN classifier on the iris dataset. 
* Split the dataset into two parts using sklearnâ€™s train test split. 
* Find the optimal value of k .
* Use my prediction model to classify a new plant.
