# Diffusion Map
I performed spectural clustering on the MNIST dataset. This method is related to Markov matrix and stationary process.

What I did:
* Compute and plot the corresponding diffusion maps with the first two diffusion maps at different time scale. Well, I don’t think the diffusion maps provide a good visualization…
